## Overview

mobject-graph is a library which allows realtime, deterministic TwinCAT programming using json (and any other format by using I_Serializer and I_Deserializer).

All nodes are "learnt" from the PLC project by clicking "Get Blueprints". At this point you can now draw and connect nodes. Changes are immediately transferred to the running PLC program and are executed. Results are sent back to the UI.
